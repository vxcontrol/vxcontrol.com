    "system_shortDescription": "Out-of-the-box system with client-server architecture to investigate incidents, collect information, and protect IT infrastructure from complex targeted attacks.",
    "system_description": "<p>Protects endpoints on Windows, Linux, and macOS with the help of an agent, the client application (the source code is written in Go, Lua, and C). The protection mechanism is based on the security policy that the agent receives from the server.</p><p>The main product functions are performed by modules developed in Lua. The luapower plugin system is used to include libraries in the assembly. Modules can be developed and debugged directly in the system web interface.</p>",

    "orchestration_shortDescription": "In-house mechanisms for delivering security policies and third-party software to endpoints.",
    "orchestration_description": "<p>You can remotely control the configuration of modules and operating system on an end device. In addition, our content delivery technologies allow you to install and configure third-party software such as Sysmon.</p><p>SOLDR's configuration management capabilities are comparable to those of leading solutions in this field, such as Puppet, SaltStack, and Chef. This allows IT teams to stop using these systems.</p>",

    "lifecycleControl_name": "Lifecycle control",
    "lifecycleControl_shortDescription": "Monitoring of systems supporting business processes and prompt intervention in case of security threats.",
    "lifecycleControl_description": "<p>SOLDR can interact with any system that supports the building of business processes and, if necessary, modify its configuration.</p><p>Allows you to analyze logs, collect key metrics, and visualize the obtained data using Jaeger, Elasticsearch, VictoriaMetrics, and Grafana.</p>",

    "detection_name": "Detection",
    "detection_shortDescription": "Endpoint data collection and analysis, triggering verification, and attack confirmation.",
    "detection_description": "<p>SOLDR analyzes vast amounts of raw data from the operating system and protection tools, detects malicious or suspicious activity, and logs information security events.</p><p>A correlator performs normalization, aggregation, and correlation of raw events and detects threats on endpoints. All suspicious files and processes can be verified using signature analysis based on YARA rules.</p>",

    "response_name": "Response",
    "response_shortDescription": "Quick and crushing response to hacker attacks.",
    "response_description": "<p>Compared to previous generation systems, SOLDR detects attacker actions quicker and responds to attacks using less resources, while taking into account organization-specific risks.</p><p>Automatic actions can be configured to respond to each dangerous security event: deleting a file, terminating a process, or isolating a host. If there is a risk of losing precious data, manual response may be used instead of automatic actions.</p>"
